Searches for a target string by crossing string combinations from a pool strings

Characters (representing the genes) are used to create random strings (representing individuals) that make up a population. Individuals from the population mate and create offspring. In every generation only a percentage of the individuals mate and only a percentage live to the next generation.

The target string, is the measure of fitness for each individual. The more fit (similar) the individual is to the target string the greater the chance they have to be selected to mate and pass on characters from their string. The goal is that eventually a generation will have an offspring that matches the target string.
